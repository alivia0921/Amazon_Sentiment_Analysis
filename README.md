# Amazon_Sentiment_Analysis


The program generates an average score for Amazon products based on past customer text review.
It web scrapes all customer text reviews from the Amazon link user-provided using Beautiful Soup and Request, then loops through the reviews, does sentiment analysis, calculates the average score of the product using text blob, and gives recommendations to the user.
