0,"  Pros :1.Small in size , handy .2.Easy to carry , Overall quality(3.5/5)Cons :1.Buttons are tough ( Will become smooth after long usage hours ).2.Usb port is rough to use"
1,"  It's very light weight keyboard and not for professional. The beginner can use this for their small work. The keys are not smooth. Wire length is sufficient for use.The seller send it with no packaging, it delivered with its original box. I get this ‚Çπ315."
2,  Button pressed easily
3,"  As I Unboxed This ZEB-KM2100, I Found That It Is Made of Plastic That Is Not Durable. A Small Force Applied At Its Ends  Tends It To Bend. Strong Force Is Sure To Break It.Okay, I Understand That I Should Not Expect Durability For The Price I Paid - ‚Çπ290.Its Keys Are Soft. It Is Light Weighted. It Worked Fine For 10 Days. 11 Day, Its 'Soft Keys' Became So Delicate That On Single Keypress, It Types Same Letter Twice (As Shown).Don't Buy It Seeing Its Price, You'll Be Disappointed. Go For Other Reputed Companies Like Dell.If You Doubt My Review (Including Screen Capture), Ignore And Go Ahead Buying It - Happy Buying :)"
4,  The keys stop working and don't respond for few minutes. For 5-6 days the keyboard worked very well... But now i m facing such problems. Unsatisfied with this product üôÅüôÅüò†
5,"  Review after 1.5 months, this keyboard is awesome, because you can use a new keyboard at such low price, although i bet it wouldn't last more than 6 months of rugged use, but it will run fine till 6-8 months of rugged use, mine came broken (just a little bit of corner), so did everyone else get a broken keyboard nonetheless it's great, it's a great substitute for those ‚Çπ600 dell keyboards which are sturdy(if you can't afford one like me). This keyboard will easily last more than one year on normal use. It's extremely lightweight, compact. Smells like all those other cheap Chinese toys and gadgets do from inside when it's new, the keys are flimsy and after few months of usage you would have to press extremely hard on the keys for it to work. The keys are of extremely cheap quality kept in a socket, but works great, no locking mechanism but keys won't fall off. Overall an excellent keyboard replacement. Works for me I don't know if it works for others or not, don't expect fast inputs from this keyboard, this keyboard even takes about few seconds to connect, so not for gaming obviously."
6,"  Budget keyboard with iPhone 6 features.Offers more than expected.Backspace key works only on 'very hard' press, and other keys work only on 'hard press'.Soft Press is like child-lock. No matter which key you press, nothing happens. Tap the beats of your favorite song while staying assured that not a thing will get typed(except 'L'). You could record the sound of key-presses and play it to get a typewriter effect.The 'L' key has feather touch... You type one 'L' once and you get two extra 'L' printed, absolutely free.The spacebar key has a nice upward slope as you slide your finger from left to right end.Compact, budget friendly. The kind you would find in Cyber Cafe.Guess what, its the ""Zindagi ke sath bhi, Zindagi ke baad bhi"" kind... As you CAN NOT RETURN it.Got it 30mins ago, just realized it has a replace-only warranty.Ordered it for WFH, but it turned out to be utter crap.Keys are so densely packed, and they don't work unless you put in an extra effort.It would be a steal deal for people who do all the typing with one finger only.Rs. 350/- wasted.... Willing to sell it off on OLX in 100rs.@Seller: you may take it back for free and sell it again to someone who might need it.#Peace"
7,"  I am a regular user and I loved it!Reasons:1. The major reason to love this product is it makes no noise! It's quiet. I do not like that 'khat-khat' noise when typing. I am an extremely fast typer and the noise would have become unbearble if it made any! Thank god for that! I was looking for exactly this kind of keyboard.2. The overall size is not too small, neither too big! It is just perfect for personal use.3. I am not a gamer but I hope to use the multimedia keys for watching movies etc. If you are buying this for regular use at uome or as a substitute for your laptop keypad, go for it!"
8,  The worst product I have ever seen on amazon. Keyboard was broken at corner. Worst keyboard. I had never written a bad review like this any time before.
9,  Pros+Lowest price.+Full function wired keyboard for personal computer and laptops+ Zebranics brand produces good products at affordable prices.Cons15% smaller than a regular keyboard. Space between keys is less.So I face a little bit of discomfort while typing.Built quality is not up to the mark. Don't expect better quality at this price.The packaging is also not secured. In transportation high chances are there for damage.I can't excuse in proper packaging. Amzon must take care of packaging. Particularly in this product.
